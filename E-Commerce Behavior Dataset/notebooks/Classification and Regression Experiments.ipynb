I think, even then, with that level of granularity, I’d still struggle. I’m not entirely sure if this is even a wise set of things to be predicting over.\n"

    "We wanted to see if an event type could be determined given price, view count, category id, and brand, as it allows us to see if we can automate the process of determining how specific conditions might make a product appealing, but not fully added to a cart. If an item, for example, is interesting to look at, but not often being purchased, perhaps it means that the price isn’t right. If it’s not even being looked at, then perhaps the product and the price are the issue.\n",

    "Using a randomforest is simple and has thus far proven trustworthy and efficient at getting high results. As expected, it returned a 98% accuracy with slight underfitting, which isn’t an issue. We could attempt to deepen the trees, and widen the amount of trees itself, but that likely wouldn’t amount to much. Instead, we wanted to see again how different a neural network approach may be. However, this also didn’t change much in the report, as it was still predicting very well. \n",

    "Having more features that allow for complex relationships to be modeled would be helpful. I wish there was some kind of “also_purchased” which gave an n-depth look at what related items were purchased in a short timespan around this action. This way, users can be better classified, and their behavior fit to trends.\n"
