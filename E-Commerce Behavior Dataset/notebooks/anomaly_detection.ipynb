    "Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is the algorithm that was implemented on the dataset. Local Outlier Factor has 5 steps that should be focused on. These steps include calculating the distance between points, determining k and k-nearest neighbors, computing reachability distances, calculating the Local Reachability Density for each point, computing the LOF score for each point, and identifying outliers based on the score. \n",
